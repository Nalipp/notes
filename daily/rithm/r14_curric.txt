  Put is usefull because if a user puts multiple times it will still be the same result (replaces the entire resource)
    Not all fields have to change, put does not change the id (it is an update)

databases-intro

-intro
  what databases do we know?
  how many have written to a db
  how many have worked with sql as a part of their job?
  what is a database?? in relation to a web server

-database
  'efficently'
  why don't we just use a spreadsheet or txt file?

  limitations to spreadsheets
    speed - can't hold very large data
    accuracy -there are no validations
    security / reliability
    more powerful interaction with the data
      query, sort, manipulate

  compare with .xml files
    take less space
    more reliable
    validations
    rollback transaction

-databases in the web stack
  ask them what we mean by client, server, database
  talk about what we have learned and will learn

-relational databases
  difference between sql and no-sql
    generally speaking it is a table vs an object (we will dive in more in visualizing relational databases with tables on the screen)
    https://scalegrid.io/blog/2019-database-trends-sql-vs-nosql-top-databases-single-vs-multiple-database-use/

  rdbms - postgres is an rmdbs, we can think of an rmdbs as the entire system
  schema - the blueprint for the data
  sql -language that interacts with the rdbms

-Where is a database
  talk about file extensions
    .word
    .xml
    .py
    .js

-Why do we need to seed a db

  visualizing relational databases
    show the table and then talk about how these tables could be used if the company was amazon

  why should we re-direct instead of rendering a template after a form submission
    prevents the user from pushing the back button after a form submission

  why do we use a post request in a form vs a get request
    if you refresh the page the form doesn't get submitted multiple times

flask-intro (lecture)

  Today we are going to learn how to create a server!
  what is a server
  We will be using our new knowledge of virtual environments with flask to handle much of the heavy lifting
  what is a server framework

  show them an example of an already built flask app, don't go through instalation and venv on slide one
    make get requests from both the browser and insomnia

  from Installing flask 
    start from the very beginning building a flask app


  Running a flask app
    introduce environmental variables
      There are multiple ways you can set environmental variables
        passing them in at runtime 
        setting them to ther terminal once per session
        show in ~/.bash_profile


Web frameworks
  talk some about rails, node, flask, django
  make the distinction between a web server that serves html and one that serves json (api)

  flask is a framework
    library vs framework



What is WSGI?
WSGI is the Web Server Gateway Interface. It is a specification that describes how a web server communicates with web applications, and how web applications can be chained together to process one request.


  what is a web framework?
    Though it’s also used to refer to computer systems and even internet “appliances,”


  what is __name__ in
    app = Flask(__name__)
    When we create a Flask application, it needs to know what module to scan for things like routes (covered later)–so the __name__ is required and should always be written like that.



  what are decorators?

    A Route is an act of binding a URL to a view function. 
    A view function is simply a function which responds to the request. 
    In Flask, we use route decorator provided by the Flask instance to associate a URL to a view function

    @app.route('/')
    def index():   #this is a view function
        return 'Hello World'

      This code registers the index() view function as a handler for the root URL of the application. 
      In other words, everytime the application receives a request where the path is "/" the index() function will be invoked to complete the request.

url parameter vs query string

  If you want to identify a resource, you should use Path Variable. 
  But if you want to sort or filter items, then you should use query parameter.

python-tools (lecture)

  To list all python libraries installed with pip
  >>> help('modules')

  if you are running the repl 


error handling
  after showing the difference between js eveything is undefined

  show js way of err handling
  then show python way of err handling including 
    except NameError as exe
    except ValueError as exe

  then show supporting slides

difference between pip and pip3

in a virtual environment python3 is defalut so you don't need to specify pip3
macs come preinstalled with python2 you have to manually install python3 so you might have an issue installing to the wrong global python library
when calling 'pip install' globally you are required to use 'pip3 install'



****************************************************************************************************

  know shallow vs deep copy

    lst = [1, 2, 3]                                                                              

    l2 = ['a', 'b', l1]                                                                          

    l3 = l2.copy()   # makes a shallow copy of the list

    l3[2] is lst                                                                                 
    False

    l3[2] == lst                                                                                 
    True

  know how to split and join in python


****************************************************************************************************
python-intro (lecture)

  know main differences between js and python

    strongly typed langauge vs weakly typed langauge
      strongly typed languages do not allow for type coercion

    python is strongly typed


--------------------------------------------------
hack-or-snooze (lab)

  concepts :
    instance vs class methods (static methods)

    static is how you create Class methods in js
      class methods :
        do not rely on values from the specific instance of the class
        aren't called on instances of the class. Instead, they're called on the class itself. 
        are an action on the class that has nothing to do with the specific instance of the class
        are often utility functions used to create instances of the class / clone or copy objects
        often have the 'new' keyword

      instance methods :
        often have the keyword 'this' (refering to the current instance of the class)

    you will actually get an error if you try to call a static method on an instance of the class

    classInstance = new ClassName();
    classInstance.staticMethod(); // -> type error not a function

    resources : 
      https://coryrylan.com/blog/using-static-keyword-in-javascript


  issues :

    google chrome is caching too much a not always updating after a debugger is added to the code / in the network tab there is an option for disable cache
    or try -> cmd shift r


  bugs :
    
    One of the input fields for the article submit form requires a full url with 'http://'
    <input required type="url" />
    however, this was not being enforced properly in the browser for one group.
    They were able to submit urls without 'http://' which caused a 401 error, but thought it was an axios issue 

    


--------------------------------------------------
lab jquery-dom
  
  key concepts :
    event delegation
    event propigation

    resources :
      https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/







Axios allows you to make requests with multiple syntaxes
For favorite and unfavorite an article, a group was able to PUT with one syntax and used the exact same syntax with DELETE and had an error
  DELETE worked with `params : { data : { token : '' } }`
  PUT would not work with the same syntax

How to make post notes to curric

  Nate  11:54 AM
  I wanted to upload some notes to curric about todays lecture.
  Was there a specific file extension I should use?

  elie  11:55 AM
  notes for instructors or for students?

  Nate  11:56 AM
  for instructors

  elie  11:56 AM
  yeah!
  11:56
  make a folder called meta





  11:56
  and inside of it an index.rst
  11:56
  that folder name does not get zipped up when we upload it, but it’s locally available for us to check out

  Nate  11:56 AM
  ok perfect!
  11:58
  So the meta belongs in each lectures folder for example lectures/intermediate-js-2/meta/index.rxt

  elie  11:58 AM
  exactly
