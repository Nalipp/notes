event que

1 stack 
2 heap 
   memory is allocated for variables 
3 queue
    the que is special to javaScript
    First in first out data structure

last in first out

tick of the event loop
  process next tick

set timout dosen't wait until 4 seconds.. the call stack must still be empty

set immediate is essentially set timout 0

callbacks are used to manage asyncronous code

// classic interview question

stack goes to the heap then waits in the que until the stack is clear

update node to 8.2.1
