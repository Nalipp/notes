round robin list / game

-What will happen when we run the following code? (hoisting)
  function foo() {
    console.log(’hi is...’, hi);
  }

  foo();

  var hi = 5;

Describe and give standard operations (withtimecomplexities)for:
  ○ Stack lifo
  ○ Queue fifo
  ○ Array
  ○ LinkedList 
  ○ Tree
  ○ Graph
  ○ HashMap/Table
  BFS vs DFS

-What is a pure function 
  Given the same input, will always return the same output.
  Produces no side effects, they do not alter any outside state, they do not mutate shared state
  Pure functions are stable and easy to test
  They are a simple reusable building block
  They are independent of each other’s state

-What is Ajax? Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
  Alows us to 
    make single page applications
    Update a web page without reloading the page
    Read data from a web server - after a web page has loaded
    Send data to a web server - in the background

-What is responsive design why is it important?
  media queries

-What is asynchronous code and why is it useful
  Where are some cases you’ve used or seen asynchronous code?

-How to compare two objects in JavaScript?
  For deep object comparison use external libs like ‘deep-equal’ / ‘lodash’ or implement your own recursive equality algorithm.

-What are some of the features from es6 es2015? What are you most excited about?
  arrow functions, classes, destructuring, iterators + for..of, rest + spread operators, let + const, includes

-What is the difference between == and ===?
  js strict equality vs equality comparison operators
  equality operator has type coercion

-In CSS, What is the difference between an ID and a class?
  ID is used to identify one dom element
  Class is used to identify multiple elements

- What is the difference between HTML vs DOM?
  HTML is parsed by the browser to create the DOM
  Javascript can be used to update the DOM
  The DOM are the actual state of elements that we see in the browser

-In Css, What is absolute positioning?
  Absolute - the element is positioned absolutely to its first positioned parent. (such as a relative positioned element or if none the body)
  Relative - the element is positioned relative to its normal position.
  Fixed - the element is positioned related to the browser window.

-Explain how scope works in javascript (hint: how do the different variable declaration keywords behave differently in relation to scope)

-List the steps that you should take when approaching a whiteboarding challenge
  --------------------------------------------------
  1. Repeat the question back to the interviewer
  2. Question the inputs
  3. Write down requirements
  --------------------------------------------------
  4. Create more inputs / test cases
  5. Pseudo-code 
  --------------------------------------------------
  6. Write code
  7. Test
  --------------------------------------------------

-React, What is the virtual dom tree and why is it important
  React uses virtual DOM to enhance its performance. 
  It is easier and more efficient that work with the actual dom
  React uses an efficient diff algorithm to compare the versions of virtual DOM. 
  It then makes sure that batched updates are sent to the real DOM for repainting or re-rendering of the UI

-React, Explain the ways that a component can get access to data
  Props
  Redux / Context

-React, What is Redux and what problem does it solve

-React, In react what does it mean that data is one directional?
  What workaround can we use to pass data (such as from a form) up to a parent component

-What what do we mean by divide and conquer algorithms?
  Why is this so important

-difference between static methods and instance methods
  Methods that belong to a class an not to specific instances of a class
  Often times static methods are used to create instances of a class
  They can also be used to encapsulate logic related to a class but not a specific instance 

-What is closure and why would we use it?
  The ability for inner functions to remember variables defined in outer functions, long after the outer function has returned
  Useful for encapsulating logic and creating private variables

  function idGenerator() {
    let start = 0;
    return function generate() {
      start++;
      return start;
    };
  }

-what is an IFFE why might it be useful? (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
  Is a good way at protecting the scope of your function and the variables within it. 
  They allow us to encapsulate state so that it doesn’t pollute the global state
  An IFFE is one specific way to create closure 

  const $ = (function() {
    const version = ‘3.1.4’;
    return {
      displayVersion() {
        return version;
      },
      html(elem) {
        return document.querySelector(elem).innerHTML;
      }
    };
  })();

  for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++){
    setTimeout(function(){
      console.log(i)
    }, 1000)
  }

-What is meant by Imperative vs Declarative code (list of imperative vs declarative types of code)
  Imperative: uses specific control statements guide the program step by step
    For loop
  Declarative: expresses logic without describing the precise control flow
    SQL queries

-In JS what does the new keyword do
  1. creates an object
  2. reassigns the this keyword to that object
  3. it makes a link the prototype
  4. add an implicit return of ‘this’

-What is JSON and how is it different than regular JavaScript?
  JavaScrip object notation
  it is a string
  double quotes

-React what is JSX
  turns html like syntax into javascirpt allowing us to write html inside of javascript

From the outcomes-web-review lecture
  Same Origin Policy
  CORS
  CSRF

OOP
  encapsulation: 
    The state in a class instance should be kept private
    Other class instances should only be able to interact with the state through public methods
  abstraction:
    Allows us to hide implementation details and reduce complexity
  inheritance:
    Common logic should be shared among classes, one way to achieve this is through inheritance
  polymorphism:
