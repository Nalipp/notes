async programing
*******************************************************************************************

callback function
  a function that gets passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some event happens

what is async programing in javascript

  call stack
  node apis
  callback que
  event loop

  call stack
    like a can of tennis balls
      -> if you add a ball to the top you can't remove the ball from the bottom of the can without removing the top first
      -> things stak on the top, last in first out, first in last out

      var one = 1;
      var two = 2;

      var one gets added to the call stack is executed and imediately removed before var two is added to the call stack
      in this example you are moving line by line through the program

      function are a little different
        when you call a function will be added and stay in the call stack until it returns a value

  node apis
    functions that are included in javascript such as setTimeout() are executed in the call stack and registered in node apis
    once executed they are passed to the callback que

  callback que
    functions that have been ran in the node apis are stored and wait to be ran by the event loop
    
  event loop
    watches the call stack and waits for it to be empty and then runs events that have been registered in the callback que
