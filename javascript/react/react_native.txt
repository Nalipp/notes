Create React Native App -> 
  don't need to write native code (runs on both) 
  can develop on your actual phone
  not locked in, you can eject anytime
  can't be added to an existing Andriod or IOS app

  ? is more customizable because it allows you to develop natively


Expo -> 
  an app that you download on your mobile device
  allows us to create apps using javascript, requires little configuration

  ðŸ’¡ Bundling Error (Unexpected Token)ðŸ’¡

  If you're seeing bundling errors while attempting to run a simulator, try changing your Babel preset for React Native to version 2.1.0. Then, remove your node-modules directory, reinstall with npm install, and run the simulator again. For more information, check out this post on Stack Overflow.
