How to solve coding challenges in JS?


How to get good at solving coding challenges.

  What is a coding challenge and why do we care?
    -Get a job
    -Get into a bootcamp
    -Solve a computer related problem / automation

  First you have to learn how to approach problems using the constraints of a computer
    there are typical paths for solving problems

  What fundamentals do we need before we attempt to solve coding challenges?
    what are they
    where can you learn them

  the jump between learning and actuallly applying the fundamentals to solving problems can be difficult

  How do we solve coding challenges
    three step process

What is code?
  
  introduction

  analogy between a musical instrument keys and core repeated concepts across different coding langauges

  explanation
    computer as memory
      what is a computer?
        a stack of memory
    
    a coding language allows us to interact with the memory on our computer

    a calculator
      a variable

    what can we store in a variable
        Number
        String
        Boolean
        Nothingness

    functions
      repeated code

    collections of primitive data
      list
      hash table

    iteration
    
    if else conditions

  Maybe you want to get a job as a developer, maybe you want to automate somthing, maybe you are just curious about coding.

  So, for whatever reason you are learning to code.
  Maybe you have spent some time learning about the fundamentals of coding.
  Now it's time to start applying the fundamentals of coding to solving actual problems.

  Are you ready to start solving problems with code?
    This jump can actually be pretty difficult to make.
    Ask youself the following.

    In whatever language you are studying you should be comfortable with the following universal concepts
 
    Primitive data types
      String
      Number
      Boolean
      Nothingness

    Arrays / Lists
    Objects / Hash Tables
    Functions
    Iteration
    If Else control statements

    
  

    
  






    
    
      

    processor reads and writes to memory
    programming language instructs the processor
