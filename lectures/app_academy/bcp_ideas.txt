callbacks
  callbacks could be split into two lectures,
    day1 -> introduction to functional programming
              passing functions as arguments
    day2 -> imperitive vs declaritive programming
              using built in methods 
              declaritive programming -> what we want to have happen
              imperitive programming -> how we want to have happen

              declaritive -> has more abstraction but is easier to reason about
