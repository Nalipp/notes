introduciton

Hi Marshall,

Nice job with the pre-work, the extra games are nice :clap

Hi Alex,

Nice job with the prework.
Looks like you got pretty creative with webscraping projects a couple years ago. :smile

We will have our first 1:1 call most likley next week.


Hi, Wuyi I look forward to working with you as well.

Thinking more and typing less is very wise.
Speed is more error prone, something I sometimes get caught in.

Growth in how we interact with others is just as imporatnt as mastering technical knowledge.
I hope we have good interatcions with this group!
