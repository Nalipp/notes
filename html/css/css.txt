selectors

	general
		*           => selects all instances on the page but should generally not be used because it can be slow
		#id					=> should only be used when you are sure it won't need to use it again

	child selectors
		li a 				=> desendant selectors select all elements inside the parent alement, even if they are nested
									 it is best to minimize the number of selectors used to target an element and to not attach a x.class to the selector
		li < a      => selects only the elements that are directly inside the parent element and not any nested elements

	sibling selectors
