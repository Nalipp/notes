review the following

  'this' refers to the current execution context of a function.
  the execution context depends on when the function was invoked not when it was defined

  implicit binding ‘this’    when 'this' is bound to the surround object
  not implict binding ‘this' when there is no surrounding object so the execution context of 'this' is theglobal object

  call()   allows us to specify the execution context
  bind()   allows us to specify a permenent execution context so it can be passed around and never change

  context loss is when the execution context is lost and 'this' is implicitly binded to the global window
    -occurs when there is no execution context is not explicit

  closures refer to the context or scope that was present when the function was created
  access to the scope persists even if the var values change may change

  closures allow you to maintain state across event calls
  a factory function that returns a function is similar to a class in OOP

  closure allow you to associated variables (withing a lexical scope) with a function that operates on that data

  in an in-memory object that that represents an html document
  this in-memory representation can be viewed in dev tools
